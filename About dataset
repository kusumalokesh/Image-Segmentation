context:
Cityscapes data (dataset home page) contains labeled videos taken from vehicles driven in Germany. This version is a processed subsample created as part of the Pix2Pix paper. The dataset has still images from the original videos, and the semantic segmentation labels are shown in images alongside the original image. This is one of the best datasets around for semantic segmentation tasks.


Content:
This dataset has 2975 training images files and 500 validation image files. Each image file is 256x512 pixels, and each file is a composite with the original photo on the left half of the image, alongside the labeled image (output of semantic segmentation) on the right half.
